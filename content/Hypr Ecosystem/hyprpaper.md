## Configuration

The config file is located at `~/.config/hypr/hyprpaper.conf`. It is not
required.

### Setting wallpapers

Wallpapers are set as anonymous special categories. Monitor can be left empty for a fallback.

| variable | description | value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `monitor` | Monitor to display this wallpaper on. If empty, will use this wallpaper as a fallback | monitor ID |
| `path` | Path to an image file or a directory containing image files. Mutually exclusive with `paths` | path |
| `paths` | Comma-separated list of image files and/or directories. Picks one wallpaper for the current run. Mutually exclusive with `path` | string |
| `fit_mode` | Determines how to display the image. Optional and defaults to `cover` | `contain`\|`cover`\|`tile`\|`fill` |
| `timeout` | Timeout between each wallpaper change (in seconds, if `path` is a directory). Optional and defaults to 30 seconds. Does not apply to `paths`, which always selects a single wallpaper for the current run | int |
| `order`    | Determines the order to display images. For `path`, supported values are `random` and `random-shuffle`. For `paths`, supported values are `default` and `random`; `random` randomizes the startup choice | `path`: `random`\|`random-shuffle`; `paths`: `default`\|`random` |
| `recursive` | Whether to scan subdirectories recursively when `path` points to a directory or `paths` contains directories. Optional and defaults to `false` | bool |

```ini
wallpaper {
    monitor = DP-3
    path = ~/myFile.jxl
    fit_mode = cover
}

wallpaper {
    monitor = DP-2
    path = ~/myFile2.jxl
    fit_mode = cover
}

wallpaper {
    monitor = DP-1
    paths = ~/wallpapers/favs, ~/wallpapers/one.jxl, ~/wallpapers/two.jxl
    fit_mode = cover
    order = random
}

wallpaper {
    monitor = 
    path = ~/fallback.jxl
    fit_mode = cover
}

# ...
```


### Run at Startup

To run hyprpaper at startup edit `hyprland.lua` and add `hyprpaper` to your autostart commands.  
If you start Hyprland with [uwsm](../../Useful-Utilities/Systemd-start), you can also use the `systemctl --user enable --now hyprpaper.service` command.

### Misc Options

These should be set outside of the `wallpaper{...}` sections.

| variable | description | type | default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `splash` | enable rendering of the hyprland splash over the wallpaper | bool | `true` |
| `splash_offset` | how far up should the splash be displayed | float | `20` |
| `splash_opacity` | how opaque the splash is | float | `0.8` |
| `ipc` | whether to enable IPC | bool | `true` |

### Sourcing

Use the `source` keyword to source another file. Globbing, tilde expansion and relative paths are supported.

```ini
source = ~/.config/hypr/hyprpaper.d/*.conf
```

Please note it’s LINEAR. Meaning lines above the `source =` will be parsed first, then lines inside `~/.config/hypr/hyprpaper.d/*.conf` files, then lines below.

## IPC

hyprpaper supports IPC via `hyprctl`. You can set wallpapers like so:

```sh
hyprctl hyprpaper wallpaper '[mon], [path], [fit_mode]'
```

`fit_mode` is optional, and `mon` can be empty for a fallback, just like in the config file. The fallback wallpaper only applies to monitors that have never had a specific monitor target assigned.
