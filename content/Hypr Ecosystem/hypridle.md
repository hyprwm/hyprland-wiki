hypridle is Hyprland's idle management daemon.

## Configuration

Configuration is done via the config file at `~/.config/hypr/hypridle.conf`. A
config file is required; hypridle won't run without one. To run hypridle at
startup, edit `hyprland.conf` and add: `exec-once = hypridle`. If Hyprland is started with [uwsm](../../Useful-Utilities/Systemd-start), you can use `systemctl --user enable --now hypridle.service`.

### General

Variables in the `general` category:

| variable | description | type | default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| lock_cmd | command to run when receiving a dbus lock event (e.g. `loginctl lock-session`) | string | empty |
| unlock_cmd | command to run when receiving a dbus unlock event (e.g. `loginctl unlock-session`) | string | empty |
| on_lock_cmd | command to run when the session gets locked by a lock screen app | string | empty |
| on_unlock_cmd | command to run when the session gets unlocked by a lock screen app | string | empty |
| before_sleep_cmd | command to run when receiving a dbus prepare_sleep event | string | empty |
| after_sleep_cmd | command to run when receiving a dbus post prepare_sleep event | string | empty |
| ignore_dbus_inhibit | whether to ignore dbus-sent idle inhibit events (e.g. from firefox) | bool | false |
| ignore_systemd_inhibit | whether to ignore `systemd-inhibit --what=idle` inhibitors | bool | false |
| ignore_wayland_inhibit | whether to ignore Wayland protocol idle inhibitors | bool | false |
| inhibit_sleep | sleep inhibition mode, 0 - disable, 1 - normal, 2 - auto, 3 - lock notify | int | 2 |

{{< callout type=info >}}

The `general:inhibit_sleep` option is used to make sure hypridle can do certain tasks before the system goes to sleep.

Options:
- `3` makes your system wait until the session gets locked by a lock screen app. This works with all wayland session-lock apps.
- `2` (auto) selects either 3 or 1 depending on whether hypridle detects if you want to launch hyprlock before sleep.
- `1` makes the system wait until hypridle launched `general:before_sleep_cmd`.
- `0` disables sleep inhibition.

### Listeners

Hypridle uses listeners to define actions on idleness.

Every listener has a _timeout_ (in seconds). After idling for _timeout_ seconds,
`on-timeout` will fire. When action is resumed after idle, `on-resume` will
fire.

Example listener:

```ini
listener {
    timeout = 500                            # in seconds.
    on-timeout = notify-send "You are idle!" # command to run when timeout has passed.
    on-resume = notify-send "Welcome back!"  # command to run when activity is detected after timeout has fired.
}
```

You can define as many listeners as you want.

Variables in the `listener` category:

| variable | description | type | default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| timeout | idle time in seconds | int | none, value must be specified |
| on-timeout | command to run when timeout has passed | string | empty |
| on-resume | command to run when activity is detected after timeout has fired | string | empty |
| ignore_inhibit | ignore idle inhibitors (of all types) for this rule | bool | false |

### Examples

Full hypridle example with hyprlock:

```ini
general {
    lock_cmd = pidof hyprlock || hyprlock       # avoid starting multiple hyprlock instances.
    before_sleep_cmd = loginctl lock-session    # lock before suspend.
    after_sleep_cmd = hyprctl dispatch dpms on  # to avoid having to press a key twice to turn on the display.
}

listener {
    timeout = 150                                # 2.5min.
    on-timeout = brightnessctl -s set 10         # set monitor backlight to minimum, avoid 0 on OLED monitor.
    on-resume = brightnessctl -r                 # monitor backlight restore.
}

# turn off keyboard backlight, comment out this section if you dont have a keyboard backlight.
listener { 
    timeout = 150                                          # 2.5min.
    on-timeout = brightnessctl -sd rgb:kbd_backlight set 0 # turn off keyboard backlight.
    on-resume = brightnessctl -rd rgb:kbd_backlight        # turn on keyboard backlight.
}

listener {
    timeout = 300                                 # 5min
    on-timeout = loginctl lock-session            # lock screen when timeout has passed
}

listener {
    timeout = 330                                                     # 5.5min
    on-timeout = hyprctl dispatch dpms off                            # screen off when timeout has passed
    on-resume = hyprctl dispatch dpms on && brightnessctl -r          # screen on when activity is detected after timeout has fired.
}

listener {
    timeout = 1800                                # 30min
    on-timeout = systemctl suspend                # suspend pc
}
```
