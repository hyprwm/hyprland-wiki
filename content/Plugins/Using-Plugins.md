This page will tell you how to use plugins.

## Disclaimers

> [!WARNING]
> Plugins are written in C++ and will run as a part of Hyprland.  
> Make sure to _always_ read the source code of the plugins you are going to use
> and to trust the source.  
> Writing a plugin to wipe your computer is easy.
> 
> _**Never**_ trust random `.so` files you receive from other people.

## Getting plugins

Plugins come as _shared objects_, aka. `.so` files.

Hyprland does not have any "default" plugins, so any plugin you may want to use
you will have to find yourself.

## Installing / Using plugins

It is _highly_ recommended you use the Hyprland Plugin Manager, `hyprpm`. For
manual instructions, see [here](#manual).

### hyprpm

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using [permission management](../../Configuring/Permissions),
> you should allow hyprpm to load plugins by adding this to your config:
> 
> ```ini
> permission = /usr/(bin|local/bin)/hyprpm, plugin, allow
> ```
> 
> otherwise you'll get a popup asking for permission every time hyprpm tries to load a plugin.

Make sure you have the required dependencies: `cpio`, `cmake`, `git`, `meson` and `gcc`.
You might also need `-dev` packages of Hyprland's dependencies if your distro splits
binaries and headers (e.g. Fedora or Debian). 

Find a repository you want to install plugins from. As an example, we will use
[hyprland-plugins](https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprland-plugins).

```sh
hyprpm add https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprland-plugins
```

Once it finishes, you can list your installed plugins with:

```sh
hyprpm list
```

Then, enable or disable them via `hyprpm enable name` and `hyprpm disable name`.

In order for the plugins to be loaded into Hyprland, run `hyprpm reload`.

You can add `exec-once = hyprpm reload` to your Hyprland config to have
plugins loaded at startup. Optionally add `-n` flag to get notification
that plugin loaded successfully (eye candy). Note regardless of whether
`-n` is present or not, `reload` command will generate notification for
warning and error events.

To update your plugins, run `hyprpm update`.

For all options of `hyprpm`, run `hyprpm -h`.

### Manual

Different plugins may have different build methods, refer to their instructions.

If you don't have Hyprland headers installed, clone Hyprland, checkout to your
version, build Hyprland, and run `sudo make installheaders`. Then build your
plugin(s).

To load plugins manually, use `hyprctl plugin load path`.

You can unload plugins with `hyprctl plugin unload path`.

> [!WARNING]
> Path has to be absolute!

## FAQ About Plugins

### My Hyprland crashes!

Oh no. Oopsie. Usually means a plugin is broken. `hyprpm disable` it.

### How do I list my loaded plugins?

`hyprctl plugin list`

### How do I make my own plugin?

See [here](../Development/Getting-Started).

### Where do I find plugins?

You can find our featured plugins at
[hypr.land/plugins](https://hypr.land/plugins/). You can also see a list
at
[awesome-hyprland](https://github.com/hyprland-community/awesome-hyprland#plugins).
Note that it may not be complete. Lastly, you can try searching around github
for the `"hyprland plugin"` keyword.

### Are plugins safe?

As long as you read the source code of your plugin(s) and can see there's
nothing bad going on, they will be safe.

### Do plugins decrease Hyprland's stability?

Hyprland employs a few tactics to unload plugins that crash. However, those
tactics may not always work. In general, as long as the plugin is well-designed,
it should not affect the stability of Hyprland.
