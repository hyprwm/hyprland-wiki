## PR Requirements

- Clean, not hacky code
- Described changes and _why_ they were there
- Following the style (see below)

## Code Style

Please read this if you are submitting a PR, in order to minimize the amount of style nits received, and save
the time for the maintainers.

### Before you submit

Make sure you ran clang-format: `clang-format -i src/*{cpp,hpp} src/**/*{cpp,hpp}`

Check if your changes don't violate `clang-tidy`. Usually this is built into your IDE.

### Clang-format

This is non-negotiable. Your code **must** be formatted.

### Clang-tidy

Clang-tidy violations are not hard requirements, but please try to minimize them, and
_only_ ignore them if it's absolutely necessary.

I've tweaked it so that in 99% of cases you absolutely should fix it.

### Testing

Please check the [Tests](../Tests) page for information about tests in Hyprland, and related
projects.

No test regressions is a _must_, while new tests are _required_ if possible to test (e.g.
graphical stuff is not testable).

### Other

Some stuff clang-tidy / clang-format won't catch:
- No uninitialized _primitives_ (int, float, double, size_t, etc.)
- No short if braces. if your if/else body contains 1 _line_ (not 1 statement) do not put `{}` around it.
- The above rule does not apply to loops / etc
- Consider adding a `;` inside of empty function bodies
- Whenever you're initializing vectors arrays or maps with a lot of elements, add a `,` after the last element to make the styling nicer
- Consider forward-declaring things in headers if possible instead of including. Speeds up compile times.
- no `using namespace std;`, and `using namespace (anything else)` is only allowed in source files, not headers.
- prefer guards rather than nesting. `if(!valid) return;` is much better than `if (valid) { /* a billion things */ }`

### Naming conventions
Although we've used hungarian notation in the past, we are moving away from it.
The current, and new code, should use `camelCase` with an `m_` prefix if the variable is a member of a class. (not a struct)

Additionally:
 - classes have a prefix of `C`: `CMyClass`
 - structs have a prefix of `S`: `SMyStruct`
 - interfaces have a prefix of `I`: `IMyInterface`
 - global pointers for singletons have a prefix of `g_`: `g_someManager`
 - constant variables are in CAPS: `const auto MYVARIABLE = ...`

## General code requirements

### No raw pointers
This is a simple rule - don't use raw pointers (e.g. `CMyClass*`) unless _absolutely necessary_. You have `UP`, `SP` and `WP` at your disposal.
These are unique, shared and weak pointers respectively.

### No malloc
Unless absolutely necessary, do not use malloc / free. You _will_ forget to free the memory.

### Avoid dubious cleanups
If a function is a C-style allocator, e.g. `some_c_call_make_new()`, it will likely require a `some_c_call_free()`. In these cases, either:
 - wrap the thing in a C++ class, or
 - if used only within one function, use a `CScopeGuard` to always free it when the function exits.

### Use the STL
Generally, use the STL instead of trying to reinvent the wheel.

### Use hyprutils
Hyprutils provides a lot of utilities that are well-suited for hyprland (and other hypr* projects) specifically. Use them.

### No absolute includes from /src
Imagine this scenario:
```
src/
   a/
      a.hpp
   b/
      b.hpp
```

If you are in `a.hpp` and want to include `b.hpp`, you _must_ use `../b/b.hpp`, and _cannot_ use `b/b.hpp`. The latter will break plugins.

One exception you might notice in the code is absolute paths from the root are allowed, e.g. `protocols/some-protocol.hpp`.
