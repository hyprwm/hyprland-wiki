## PR Requirements

- Clean, not hacky code
- Described changes and _why_ they were there
- Following the style (see below)

## Code Style

Please read this if you are submitting a PR, in order to minimize the amount of style nits received, and save
the time for the maintainers.

### Before you submit

Make sure you ran clang-format: `clang-format -i src/**/*{cpp,hpp}`

Check if your changes don't violate `clang-tidy`. Usually this is built into your IDE.

### Clang-format

This is non-negotiable. Your code **must** be formatted.

### Clang-tidy

Clang-tidy violations are not hard requirements, but please try to minimize them, and
_only_ ignore them if it's absolutely necessary.

I've tweaked it so that in 99% of cases you absolutely should fix it.

### Other

Some stuff clang-tidy / clang-format won't catch:
- No uninitialized _primitives_ (int, float, double, size_t, etc.)
- No short ifs. if your if/else body contains 1 _line_ (not 1 statement) do not put `{}` around it.
- The above rule does not apply to loops / etc
- Consider adding a `;` inside of empty function bodies
- Whenever you're initializing vectors arrays or maps with a lot of elements, add a `,` after the last element to make the styling nicer
- Consider forward-declaring things in headers if possible instead of including. Speeds up compile times.
- no `using namespace std;`, and `using namespace (anything else)` is only allowed in source files, not headers.
- prefer guards rather than nesting. `if(!valid) return;` is much better than `if (valid) { /* a billion things */ }`

### Naming conventions
Although we've used hungarian notation in the past, we are moving away from it.
The current, and new code, should use `camelCase` with an `m_` prefix if the variable is a member of a class. (not a struct)

Additionally:
 - classes have a prefix of `C`: `CMyClass`
 - structs have a prefix of `S`: `SMyStruct`
 - namespaces have a prefix of `N`: `NMyNamespace`
 - interfaces have a prefix of `I`: `IMyInterface`
 - global pointers for singletons have a prefix of `g_`: `g_someManager`
 - constant variables are in CAPS: `const auto MYVARIABLE = ...`

## General code requirements

### No raw pointers
This is a simple rule - don't use raw pointers (e.g. `CMyClass*`) unless _absolutely necessary_. You have `UP`, `SP` and `WP` at your disposal.
These are unique, shared and weak pointers respectively.

### No malloc
Unless absolutely necessary, do not use malloc / free. You _will_ forget to free the memory.

### Avoid dubious cleanups
If a function is a C-style allocator, e.g. `some_c_call_make_new()`, it will likely require a `some_c_call_free()`. In these cases, either:
 - wrap the thing in a C++ class, or
 - if used only within one function, use a `CScopeGuard` to always free it when the function exits.

### Use the STL
Generally, use the STL instead of trying to reinvent the wheel.

### Use hyprutils
Hyprutils provides a lot of utilities that are well-suited for hyprland (and other hypr* projects) specifically. Use them.

### No absolute includes from /src
Imagine this scenario:
```
src/
   a/
      a.hpp
   b/
      b.hpp
```

If you are in `a.hpp` and want to include `b.hpp`, you _must_ use `../b/b.hpp`, and _cannot_ use `b/b.hpp`. The latter will break plugins.

One exception you might notice in the code is absolute paths from the root are allowed, e.g. `protocols/some-protocol.hpp`.

### Test your changes
Run and test your changes to make sure they work!

## Testing and CI

Since [#9297](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/pull/9297), we require each MR that fixes an issue
or adds a new feature to include test(s) for the feature, if possible.

The testing framework is incapable of testing visual changes (e.g. graphical effects), and some very
niche parts (real HID devices, etc). However, if your change is related to: binds, layouts, config options,
window management, hyprctl, dispatchers, keywords, etc. your MR _needs_ tests.

### How to run tests locally

In order to run tests locally, build Hyprland, then:
```sh
cd hyprtester
../build/hyprtester/hyprtester --plugin ./plugin/hyprtestplugin.so
```

### How to add tests

In order to add a new test, you can either make a new test file, or add a test to an existing file.
If you are adding a new test file, remember to end on a clean state: close all windows you've opened, and go back to workspace 1.

If you are adding to an existing test file, find a file that's appropriate for the category
of your test.

Tests are done by having a hyprland process active, issuing hyprctl commands, and checking the result with hyprctl queries.

Check the `hyprtester/` directory of the source repo for more.
