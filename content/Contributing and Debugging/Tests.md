title: Tests
---

Hyprland and some other projects under the hypr* umbrella have _tests_ that
try to catch bugs and regressions before code is merged.

Building in Debug will by default build tests.

## Running tests

### GTests

GTests are GoogleTests that are _unit tests_. These tests simply check how
some elements behave when they can run on their own.

In all hypr* projects, GTests are ran by ctest. Run:

```sh
ctest -j$(nproc) -C Debug --test-dir=build
```

And make sure your tests pass.

### Hyprland's hyprtester

A lot of hyprland's code cannot be unit tested, thus we have our own Hyprtester
binary which runs hyprland and issues commands and expects results.

To run Hyprtester, `cd` into `./hyprtester`, then run:

```sh
../build/hyprtester/hyprtester --plugin ./plugin/hyprtestplugin.so
```

*This will run for a while!* At the end, it will print summary results
of how many tests passed, and how many failed.

The goal of failed tests is to be **0**.

## Submitting new tests

New tests have to either be a GTest, if the thing tested is possible to be unit tested,
or a part of hyprtester.

For both test types, you can check the test directories in the project. GTests live in `tests/`,
while hyprtester tests live in `hyprtester/`.

### What to test

If you're submitting a new feature, it's obviously your feature. For a fix, try to write a test
case that would fail before your fix.

For new tests, you can inspect the coverage report.

First, run _both_ ctest and hyprtester. Then, run (from the repo root):

```sh
gcovr -r . build --html --html-details -o build/coverage.html --gcov-ignore-parse-errors="negative_hits.warn" && xdg-open ./build/coverage.html
```

this will run for a while, then open a report in your browser. You can see which files have been tested in
what amount, and click on the files to see a line-by-line breakdown.

If there are paths untested, we'd be very happy to receive tests for them.
