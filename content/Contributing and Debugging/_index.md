[the guidelines](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/blob/main/docs/ISSUE_GUIDELINES.md)

## Build in debug mode

### Required packages

See [manual build](https://wiki.hypr.land/Getting-Started/Installation/#manual-manual-build) for deps.

### Recommended, CMake

Install the VSCode C/C++ and CMake Tools extensions and use that.

I've attached a
[example/launch.json](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/blob/main/example/launch.json)
that you can copy to your .vscode/ folder in the repo root.

With that, you can build in debug, go to the debugging tab and hit
`(gdb) Launch`.

_note:_ You probably want to set `watchdog_timeout = 0` in the debug {} section
of your config. Otherwise Hyprland will notice its hanging when you hit a
breakpoint and it will crash after you continue out of it.

### Custom, CLI

`make debug`

Attach and profile in your preferred way.

### Meson

```console
meson setup build -Dbuildtype=debug
ninja -C build
```

### Nix

To build the package in debug mode, you have to override it like this:

```nix
hyprland.override {
  debug = true;
};
```

This code can go in the `package` attribute of the NixOS/Home Manager modules.

## Development environment

### Setup

Make a copy of your config in `~/.config/hypr` called `hyprlandd.conf`. `Debug`
builds automatically use `hyprlandd.conf`, but you can also pass `--config ~/path/to/conf.conf`
for an override on release / different file.

#### Recommended debug config changes

- remove _all_ `exec=` or `exec-once=` directives from your config.
- change default modifier for binds (e.g. `SUPER` -> `ALT`)

#### Launch the dev env

Launch the output `Hyprland` binary in `./build/` _when logged into a Hyprland
session_.

A new window should open with Hyprland running inside of it. You can now test stuff
in the nested session without worrying about nuking your actual
session, and also being able to debug it easily. I'd also recommend to launch Hyprland
with some sort of a debugger, like `gdb`. Your IDE (if you use one) can likely do it
for you, otherwise `gdb ./build/Hyprland` should suffice. This will help you debug
crashes.

For gdb, when Hyprland crashes, gdb will stop and allow you to inspect the current state
with commands like `bt`, `frame`, `print`, etc. An IDE will allow you to do it
graphically.

## LSP and Formatting

If you want proper LSP support in an editor that doesn't automatically set it
up, use clangd. You'll probably notice there will be a bunch of warnings
because we haven't generated compile commands, to do this run:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build/ -G Ninja -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
```

Also, before submitting a PR please format with clang-format, to run this only
on your changes run `git-clang-format` in your projects root directory.

## Logs, dumps, etc

You can use the logs and the GDB debugger, but running Hyprland in debug compile
as a driver and using it for a while might give more insight to the more random
bugs.

When Hyprland crashes, use `coredumpctl` and then `coredumpctl info PID` to see
the dump. See the instructions below for more info about `coredumpctl`.

You can also use the amazing command

```sh
watch -n 0.1 "grep -v \"arranged\" $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/hypr/$HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE/hyprland.log | tail -n 40"
```

for live logs. (replace `hyprland` with `hyprlandd` for debug builds)

### How do I get a coredump?
