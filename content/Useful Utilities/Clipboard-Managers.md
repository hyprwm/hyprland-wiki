title: Clipboard Managers
---

_Starting method:_ manual (`exec-once`)

Clipboard Managers provide a convenient way to organize and access previously
copied content, including both text and images.  
Some common ones include:

- [`cliphist`](https://github.com/sentriz/cliphist) - Utilizes Wayland with `wl-clipboard` and can store both images and
text.

- [`clipman`](https://github.com/chmouel/clipman) - Utilizes Wayland with `wl-clipboard` support and stores text only

- [`clipse`](https://github.com/savedra1/clipse) - Utilizes Wayland with `wl-clipboard` support and runs from a single
binary.  
Stores text and images indefinitely, accessible via a nice TUI that can be bound to a floating window in your Hyprland config.  
Allows custom themes, image/text previews, multi-select, pinned items and more.

- [`copyq`](https://github.com/hluk/CopyQ) - Supports text, images, and various other formats. It offers searchable history, editing capabilities, and a scripting interface. You can also organize items into tabs and synchronize clipboards across different devices.

- [`wl-clip-persist`](https://github.com/Linus789/wl-clip-persist) - When copying something on Wayland, the copied data remains in the clipboard until the application that was copied from is closed; after that, the data disappears and can no longer be pasted.  
To fix this problem, you can use `wl-clip-persist` which will preserve the data in the clipboard after the application is closed.

## cliphist

Start by adding the following lines to your `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`

```ini
exec-once = wl-paste --type text --watch cliphist store # Stores only text data
exec-once = wl-paste --type image --watch cliphist store # Stores only image data
```

Note that any of the above lines can be disabled based on your needs.

To bind `cliphist` to a hotkey and display it under `rofi`, `dmenu`, `wofi` or `fuzzel`,
you can edit it in `hyprland.conf`.

{{< tabs items="rofi,dmenu,wofi,fuzzel" >}}

{{< tab >}}
```ini
bind = SUPER, V, exec, cliphist list | rofi -dmenu | cliphist decode | wl-copy
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
```ini
bind = SUPER, V, exec, cliphist list | dmenu | cliphist decode | wl-copy
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
```ini
bind = SUPER, V, exec, cliphist list | wofi --dmenu | cliphist decode | wl-copy
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
```ini
bind = SUPER, V, exec, cliphist list | fuzzel --dmenu | cliphist decode | wl-copy
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

The binds above bind `SUPER + V` to access the clipboard history.  
For further info, please refer to the program's GitHub repository linked above.

## clipman

Start by adding the following line to your `hyprland.conf`

```ini
exec-once = wl-paste -t text --watch clipman store --no-persist
```

If you wish to use it as a primary clipboard manager, use this instead:

```ini
exec-once = wl-paste -p -t text --watch clipman store -P --histpath="~/.local/share/clipman-primary.json"
```

Ensure that `~/.local/share/clipman-primary.json` is already created.

Now you can bind `clipman` like this:

{{< tabs items="rofi,dmenu,wofi,fuzzel" >}}

{{< tab >}}
```ini
bind = SUPER, V, exec, clipman pick -t rofi
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
```ini
bind = SUPER, V, exec, clipman pick -t dmenu
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
```ini
bind = SUPER, V, exec, clipman pick -t wofi
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
```ini
bind = SUPER, V, exec, clipman pick -t STDOUT | fuzzel --dmenu | wl-copy
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

...and so on.  
For further information, please refer to the program's GitHub repository linked above.

## clipse

Start by adding the following line to your `hyprland.conf`

```ini
exec-once = clipse -listen
```

You can bind the TUI to a something nice like this:

```ini
windowrule = float, class:(clipse)
windowrule = size 622 652, class:(clipse)
windowrule = stayfocused, class:(clipse)

bind = SUPER, V, exec, alacritty --class clipse -e clipse
```

Replace `alacritty` with the terminal environment you use if necessary.  
The class is optional, but it's recommended to use a floating window to achieve more
GUI-like behavior.

For more details on `clipse`, please refer to its GitHub repo linked at the top
of the page.

## copyq

Start by adding the following lines to your `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`

```ini
exec-once = copyq --start-server
```

If the main window of `copyq` cannot close or hide properly, try to enable its
"Hide main window" option in the Layout configuration tab in the Preferences
dialog.

## wl-clip-persist

Add the following line to `hyprland.conf`.  
No other changes are required. The basic wayland copy/paste mechanisms will now persist even when the source window is closed.

```ini
exec-once = wl-clip-persist --clipboard regular
```

Can also be applied to the primary selection (i.e. middle click to paste selection) too, but this is not recommended because the primary selection [has unintended side-effects for some GTK applications.](https://github.com/Linus789/wl-clip-persist#primary-selection-mode-breaks-the-selection-system-3)

```ini
exec-once = wl-clip-persist --clipboard primary
```
