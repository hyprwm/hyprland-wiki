This page describes Hyprland's built-in lightweight notifications.

> [!NOTE]
> Hyprland's built-in notifications are not meant to handle your system notifications.
> They are much simpler, text-only popups in the corner of your monitor.

## Lua

In lua, notifications are exposed via the `hl.notification` module.

### Functions

- `hl.notification.create({ text, duration, icon?, color?, font_size? }) → HL.Notification` → Push a notification
- `hl.notification.get()` → Get a table of all active notifications as `HL.Notification` objects

## Hyprctl

From hyprctl, you can create a notification with the `hyprctl notify` command:

```sh
hyprctl notify [ICON] [TIME_MS] [COLOR] [MESSAGE]
```
