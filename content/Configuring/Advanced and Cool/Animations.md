## General

Animations are declared with the `hl.animation()` method.

Example:
```lua
hl.animation({ leaf = STRING, enabled = BOOLEAN, speed = FLOAT, curve = STRING[, style = STRING] })
```
`leaf` is scope of the animation. See [Animation tree](#animation-tree)

`enable` use `true` to disable, `false` to enable. _Note:_ if it's `false`, you
can omit further args.

`speed` is the amount of ds (1ds = 100ms) the animation will take. For example `speed = 1` = 100ms

`curve` is the bezier curve name, see [curves](#curves).

`style` (optional) is the animation style. See [Animation tree](#animation-tree)

### Examples

```lua
hl.animation({ leaf = "workspaces", enabled = true, speed = 8, curve = "default" })
hl.animation({ leaf = window, enabled = true, speed = 10, curve = "myepiccurve", style = "slide"})
hl.animation({ leaf = "fade", enabled = 0 })
```

### Animation tree
The animations are a tree. If an animation is unset, it will inherit its
parent's values.

```txt
global
  ↳ windows - styles: slide, popin, gnomed
    ↳ windowsIn - window open - styles: same as windows
    ↳ windowsOut - window close - styles: same as windows
    ↳ windowsMove - everything in between, moving, dragging, resizing.
  ↳ layers - styles: slide, popin, fade
    ↳ layersIn - layer open
    ↳ layersOut - layer close
  ↳ fade
    ↳ fadeIn - fade in for window open
    ↳ fadeOut - fade out for window close
    ↳ fadeSwitch - fade on changing activewindow and its opacity
    ↳ fadeShadow - fade on changing activewindow for shadows
    ↳ fadeDim - the easing of the dimming of inactive windows
    ↳ fadeLayers - for controlling fade on layers
      ↳ fadeLayersIn - fade in for layer open
      ↳ fadeLayersOut - fade out for layer close
    ↳ fadePopups - for controlling fade on wayland popups
      ↳ fadePopupsIn - fade in for wayland popup open
      ↳ fadePopupsOut - fade out for wayland popup close
    ↳ fadeDpms - for controlling fade when dpms is toggled
  ↳ border - for animating the border's color switch speed
  ↳ borderangle - for animating the border's gradient angle - styles: once (default), loop
  ↳ workspaces - styles: slide, slidevert, fade, slidefade, slidefadevert
    ↳ workspacesIn - styles: same as workspaces
    ↳ workspacesOut - styles: same as workspaces
    ↳ specialWorkspace - styles: same as workspaces
      ↳ specialWorkspaceIn - styles: same as workspaces
      ↳ specialWorkspaceOut - styles: same as workspaces
  ↳ zoomFactor - animates the screen zoom
  ↳ monitorAdded - monitor added zoom animation
```

> [!WARNING]
> Using the `loop` style for `borderangle` requires Hyprland to _constantly_ render new frames at a frequency equal to your screen's refresh rate (e.g. 60 times per second for a 60hz monitor), which might stress your CPU/GPU and will impact battery life. <br>
> This will apply even if animations are disabled or borders are not visible.

## Curves

Defining your own [Bézier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve) can be done with the `hl.curve` function:

```lua
hl.curve( NAME, { type = STRING, points = { {X0, Y0}, {X1, Y1} } })
```

where `NAME` is a name of your choice and `X0, Y0, X1, Y1` are the the two control points for a Cubic Bézier curve. <br>
A good website to design your own Bézier can be [cssportal.com](https://www.cssportal.com/css-cubic-bezier-generator/). <br>
If you want to instead choose from a list of pre-made Béziers, you can check out [easings.net](https://easings.net).

### Example

```lua
hl.curve({ "overshoot", { type = "bezier", points = { {0.5, 0.9}, {0.1, 1.1} } } })
```

### Extras

For animation style `popin` in `windows`, you can specify a minimum percentage
to start from. For example, the following will make the animation 80% -> 100% of
the size:

```lua
hl.animation({ leaf = "windows", enabled = true, speed = 8, curve = "default", style = "popin 80%" })
```

For animation styles `slide`, `slidevert`, `slidefade` and `slidefadevert` in `workspaces`, you can
specify a movement percentage. For example, the following will make windows move
20% of the screen width:

```lua
hl.animation({ leaf = "workspaces", enabled = true, speed = 8, curve = "default", style = "slidefade 20%" })
```

For animation style `slide` in `windows` and `layers` you can specify a forced side. <br>
You can choose between `top`, `bottom`, `left` or `right`.

```lua
hl.animation({ leaf = "windows", enabled = true, speed = 8, curve = "default", style = "slide left" })
```
