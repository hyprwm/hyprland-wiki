Please keep in mind some layout-specific dispatchers will be listed in the
layout pages (See the sidebar).

## Dispatchers

Dispatchers return tables that describe an action you want to make. They do not invoke any action immediately, and their
contents are not guaranteed to be stable at all. Their purpose is to be fed into `hl.bind()` or `hl.dispatch()`.

### Parameter explanation

|  Param type | Description  |
|---|---|
| `action` | `toggle`(default if no value given), `enable`/`on`, `disable`/`off` |

#### Window

A window. Can be:
 - window object
 - regexes:
   - `class:...`
   - `initialclass:...`
   - `title:...`
   - `initialtitle:...`
   - `tag:...`
 - exact selectors:
   - `pid:...`
   - `address:0x...`
 - `activewindow`
 - `floating`
 - `tiled`

If no window is provided, the active window is used.

#### Workspace

A workspace. Can be:
 - workspace object
 - workspace ID
 - workspace selector, see [below]({{< relref "#workspace selectors" >}})

#### Direction

A simple direction. `l` / `r` / `u` / `d`

#### Monitor

A monitor. Can be:
 - monitor object
 - monitor ID
 - direction
 - name
 - `desc:` and description
 - `current`
 - relative: `+1` / `-2`

## Dispatchers

### General

`hl.dsp.` contains:

| method | description |
| --- | --- |
| `exec_cmd(cmd, rules?)` | execute a command. Rules can be a table of window rule effects to apply. |
| `exec_raw(cmd)` | execute a raw command. While `exec_cmd` will do `bash -c`, this won't. |
| `focus({ direction })` | move the focus in a direction |
| `focus({ monitor })` | move the focus to a monitor |
| `focus({ workspace, on_current_monitor? })` | move the focus to a workspace |
| `focus({ window })` | move the focus to a window |
| `focus({ urgent_or_last })` | move the focus to an urgent, or last window |
| `focus({ last })` | move the focus to the last window |
| `exit()` | quit Hyprland. It's recommended to use `hyprshutdown` instead of this. |
| `submap(name)` | move to a submap |
| `pass({ window? })` | pass the shortcut to a window |
| `send_shortcut({ mods, key, window? })` | send a specific shortcut to a window |
| `send_key_state({ mods, key, state, window? })` | same as above, but you control `down` / `up` |
| `layout(message)` | send a layout message as a string |
| `dpms({ action?, monitor? })` | toggle monitors on/off (not physically, as in idle-screensaver.) |
| `event(string)` | send an event to socket2. |
| `global(string)` | activate a dbus global shortcut. See [Binds > Global Shortcuts](../Binds#DBus-Global-Shortcuts) |
| `force_idle(seconds)` | sets elapsed time for all idle timers, ignoring idle inhibitors. Timers return to normal behavior upon the next activity. Do not use with a keybind directly. |

> [!WARNING]
> [uwsm](../../../Useful-Utilities/Systemd-start) users should avoid using `exit` dispatcher, or terminating Hyprland process directly, as exiting Hyprland this way removes it from under its clients and interferes with ordered shutdown sequence. Use `exec, uwsm stop` (or [other variants](https://github.com/Vladimir-csp/uwsm#how-to-stop)) which will gracefully bring down graphical session (and login session bound to it, if any). If you experience problems with units entering inconsistent states, affecting subsequent sessions, use `exec, loginctl terminate-user ""` instead (terminates all units of the user).
> 
> It's also strongly advised to replace the `exit` dispatcher inside `hyprland.conf` keybinds section accordingly.

> [!WARNING]
> It is NOT recommended to set DPMS or forceidle with a keybind directly, as it
> might cause undefined behavior. Instead, consider something like
> 
> ```lua
> hl.bind("...", function()
>                  hl.timer(function()
>                    hl.dispatch(hl.dsp.dpms({ action = "disable" }))
>                  end, {timeout = 500, type = "oneshot"})
>                end)
> ```

### Grouped (tabbed) windows

Hyprland allows you to make a group from the current active window with the
`hl.dsp.group.toggle()` bind dispatcher.

A group is like i3wm’s “tabbed” container. It takes the space of one window, and
you can toggle the windows within it.

You can lock a group with the `lock` dispatcher in order to stop new
windows from entering this group.

You can prevent a window from being added to a group or becoming a group with the
`window.deny_from_group` dispatcher. `move({ window_or_group })` will behave like
`move({ window })` if the current active window or window in direction has this property
set.

## Workspace selectors

You have nine choices:

- ID: e.g. `1`, `2`, or `3`

- Relative ID: e.g. `+1`, `-3` or `+100`

- workspace on monitor, relative with `+` or `-`, absolute with `~`: e.g. `m+1`,
  `m-2` or `m~3`

- workspace on monitor including empty workspaces, relative with `+` or `-`,
  absolute with `~`: e.g. `r+1` or `r~3`

- open workspace, relative with `+` or `-`, absolute with `~`: e.g. `e+1`,
  `e-10`, or `e~2`

- Name: e.g. `name:Web`, `name:Anime` or `name:Better anime`

- Previous workspace: `previous`, or `previous_per_monitor`

- First available empty workspace: `empty`, suffix with `m` to only search
  on monitor. and/or `n` to make it the _next_ available empty workspace. e.g.
  `emptynm`

- Special Workspace: `special` or `special:name` for named special workspaces.

> [!WARNING]
> Numerical workspaces (e.g. `1`, `2`, `13371337`) are allowed **ONLY** between 1
> and 2147483647 (inclusive).  
> Neither `0` nor negative numbers are allowed.

## Special Workspace

A special workspace is what is called a "scratchpad" in some other places. A
workspace that you can toggle on/off on any monitor.

> [!NOTE]
> You can define multiple named special workspaces, but the amount of those is
> limited to 97 at a time.

### setprop

Props are any of the _dynamic effects_ of [Window Rules](../Window-Rules#dynamic-effects).

For example:

```lua
{ prop = "no_anim", value = "1" }
{ prop = "no_anim", value = "1", window = "class:abc" }
```

Some props are expanded from their window rule parents which take multiple arguments:
- `border_color` -> `active_border_color`, `inactive_border_color`
- `opacity` -> `opacity`, `opacity_inactive`, `opacity_fullscreen`, `opacity_override`, `opacity_inactive_override`, `opacity_fullscreen_override`

### Fullscreenstate

The `fullscreen_state` dispatcher decouples the state that Hyprland maintains for a window from the fullscreen state that is communicated to the client.  

`internal` is a reference to the state maintained by Hyprland.

`client` is a reference to the state that the application receives.

| Value | State | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -1 | Current | Maintains the current fullscreen state. |
| 0 | None | Window allocates the space defined by the current layout. |
| 1 | Maximize | Window takes up the entire working space, keeping the margins. |
| 2 | Fullscreen | Window takes up the entire screen. |
| 3 | Maximize and Fullscreen | The state of a fullscreened maximized window. Works the same as fullscreen. |

For example:

`2 0` Fullscreens the application and keeps the client in non-fullscreen mode.  

This can be used to prevent Chromium-based browsers from going into presentation mode when they detect they have been fullscreened.  

`0 2` Keeps the window non-fullscreen, but the client goes into fullscreen mode within the window.
