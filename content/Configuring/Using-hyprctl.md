title: Using hyprctl
---

`hyprctl` is a utility for controlling some parts of the compositor from a CLI
or a script. It should automatically be installed along with Hyprland.

{{< callout type=warning >}}

_hyprctl_ calls will be dispatched by the compositor _synchronously_, meaning
any spam of the utility will cause slowdowns. It's recommended to use `--batch`
for many control calls, and limiting the amount of info calls.

For live event handling, see the [socket2](../../IPC/).

{{< /callout >}}

## Commands

### dispatch

Issue a `dispatch` to call a keybind dispatcher with an argument.

An argument has to be present, for dispatchers without parameters it can be
anything.

To pass an argument starting with `-` or `--`, such as command line options
to `exec` programs, pass `--` as an option. This will disable any subsequent
parsing of options by _hyprctl_.

Examples:

```sh
hyprctl dispatch exec kitty

hyprctl dispatch -- exec kitty --single-instance

hyprctl dispatch pseudo x
```

Returns: `ok` on success, an error message on fail.

See [Dispatchers](../Dispatchers) for a list of dispatchers.

### keyword

issue a `keyword` to call a config keyword dynamically.

Examples:

```sh
hyprctl keyword bind SUPER,O,pseudo

hyprctl keyword general:border_size 10

hyprctl keyword monitor DP-3,1920x1080@144,0x0,1
```

Returns: `ok` on success, an error message on fail.

### reload

Issue a `reload` to force reload the config.

### kill

Issue a `kill` to get into a kill mode, where you can kill an app by clicking on
it. You can exit it with ESCAPE.

Kind of like xkill.

### setcursor

Sets the cursor theme and reloads the cursor manager. Will set the theme for
everything except GTK, because GTK.

Please note that since 0.37.0, this only accepts hyprcursor themes. For legacy xcursor themes,
use the `XCURSOR_THEME` and `XCURSOR_SIZE` env vars.

params: theme and size

e.g.:

```sh
hyprctl setcursor Bibata-Modern-Classic 24
```

### output

Allows you to add and remove fake outputs to your preferred backend.

Usage:

```sh
hyprctl output create [backend] (name)
```

or

```sh
hyprctl output remove [name]
```

Where `[backend]` is the name of the backend and `(name)` is an optional name
for the output. If `(name)` is not specified, the default naming scheme will be
used (`HEADLESS-2`, `WL-1`, etc.)

{{< callout type=info >}}

`create` and `remove` can also be `add` or `destroy`, respectively.

{{< /callout >}}

Available backends:

- `wayland`: Creates an output as a Wayland window. This will only work if
  you're already running Hyprland with the Wayland backend.
- `headless`: Creates a headless monitor output. If you're running a VNC/RDP/
  Sunshine server, you should use this.
- `auto`: Picks a backend for you. For example, if you're running Hyprland from
  the TTY, `headless` will be chosen.

For example, to create a headless output named "test":

```sh
hyprctl output create headless test
```

And to remove it:

```sh
hyprctl output remove test
```

### switchxkblayout

Sets the xkb layout index for a keyboard.

For example, if you set:

```ini
device {
    name = my-epic-keyboard-v1
    kb_layout = us,pl,de
}
```

You can use this command to switch between them.

```sh
hyprctl switchxkblayout [DEVICE] [CMD]
```

where `CMD` is either `next` for next, `prev` for previous, or `ID` for a
specific one (in the above case, `us`: 0, `pl`: 1, `de`: 2). You can find the
`DEVICE` using `hyprctl devices` command.

`DEVICE` can also be `current` or `all`, self-explanatory. Current is the `main` keyboard from `devices`.

Example command for a typical keyboard:

```sh
hyprctl switchxkblayout at-translated-set-2-keyboard next
```

{{< callout type=info >}}

If you want a single variant i.e. pl/dvorak on one layout but us/qwerty on the
other, xkb parameters can still be blank, however the amount of comma-separated
parameters have to match. Alternatively, a single parameter can be specified for
it to apply to all three.

```ini
input {
    kb_layout = pl,us,ru
    kb_variant = dvorak,,
    kb_options = caps:ctrl_modifier
}
```

{{< /callout >}}

### seterror

Sets the hyprctl error string. Will reset when Hyprland's config is reloaded.

```sh
hyprctl seterror 'rgba(66ee66ff)' hello world this is my problem
```

To disable:

```sh
hyprctl seterror disable
```

### getprop

Gets a property value of a window.

```sh
hyprctl getprop [window] [property]
```

Where `window` is as described [here](../Dispatchers#parameter-explanation), and `property` is any which can be set with [setprop](../Dispatchers/#setprop).

#### Notes
- If `animationstyle` is unset, `(unset)` is returned.
- `minsize` defaults to `20 20`.
- `maxsize` defaults to `inf inf` or `[null,null]` in JSON.

### notify

Sends a notification using the built-in Hyprland notification system.

```sh
hyprctl notify [ICON] [TIME_MS] [COLOR] [MESSAGE]
```

For example:

```sh
hyprctl notify -1 10000 "rgb(ff1ea3)" "Hello everyone!"
```

Icon of `-1` means "No icon"

Color of `0` means "Default color for icon"

Icon list:

```sh
WARNING = 0
INFO = 1
HINT = 2
ERROR = 3
CONFUSED = 4
OK = 5
```

Optionally, you can specify a font size of the notification like so:

```sh
hyprctl notify -1 10000 "rgb(ff0000)" "fontsize:35 This text is big"
```

The default font-size is 13.

### dismissnotify

Dismisses all or up to AMOUNT notifications.

```sh
hyprctl dismissnotify # dismiss all notifications
hyprctl dismissnotify 2 # dismiss the oldest 2 notifications
hyprctl dismissnotify -1 # dismiss all notifications (same as no arguments)
```

`;` separates the commands

## Flags

You can specify flags for the request like this:

```sh
hyprctl -j monitors
