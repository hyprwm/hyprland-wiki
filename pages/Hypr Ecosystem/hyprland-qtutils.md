hyprland-qtutils is a small bunch of utility applications that hyprland might invoke. These are stuff like dialogs or popups.

If not installed a warning on hyprland startup will be shown.<br/>
You can disable it with `misc:disable_hyprland_qtutils_check` in the config file ([ref](../Configuring/Variables)).
