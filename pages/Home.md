Hello there, dear traveler! Welcome to the Hyprland Wiki!

Take a tour of the pages on the left and read ones that you may need.

## Wayland info (especially useful for Xorg users)

A Wayland compositor is a fully autonomous Display Server, like Xorg itself.
It is **not** possible to mix'n'match Wayland compositors like you could on Xorg
with window managers and compositors. It is also not entirely possible to use
all Xorg applications on Wayland. See [../Useful-Utilities](this page) for a
list of recommended Wayland native/compatible programs.

Wayland **compositors** should not be confused with Xorg **window managers**.

## IMPORTANT

{{< hint type=important >}}
GTK apps launching slowly and/or OBS/Screensharing not working
is easily fixable by checking out the
[FAQ (GTK issue)](../FAQ/#some-of-my-apps-take-a-really-long-time-to-open)
and [FAQ (screensharing)](../FAQ/#screenshare--obs-no-worky).
