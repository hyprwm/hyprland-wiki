After you've installed Hyprland, you can either launch it from a TTY with
`Hyprland` or from a login manager. Although login managers aren't officially
supported, I recommend `SDDM`, as it's been working flawlessly with wayland
compositors.

It is recommended you have `kitty` for terminal access, (example and autogenerated configs have it bound to SUPER+Q) or for you to manually change it in the config before launching hyprland.

If you have an Nvidia card, please also take a look at [The nvidia page](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/wiki/Nvidia) before launching. You should **first** make a wrapper, as described in the section below, then follow the instructions from the Nvidia page, and then continue on with sections below. 

## Wrapping the launcher (recommended)
With Xorg, you get the `.xinitrc`. With Hyprland, you can create your own... kind of.

Make an executable file somewhere in your `PATH`, for example `~/.local/bin/`, called (for example) `wrappedHl`

In it, put:
```
#!/bin/bash

cd ~

export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1
export XCURSOR_SIZE=24

exec Hyprland
```

you can add as many exported envvars as you need (nvidia users might need a lot), but I recommend to have *at least* the shown two. You can also change the shell you launch this with, although it shouldn't matter.

You should now launch Hyprland with `wrappedHl` instead of `Hyprland`. Make sure to edit your .desktop file in `/usr/share/wayland-sessions/` if you use a login manager! (You might need to put the full path in it, as login managers are usually not ran through the user account)

## Immediate

**OMG MY SCREEN IS BROKEN, FLASHY TEARY!** -> see the bottom of this page

Once you log in, you'll be greeted with a yellow warning that will give you some
basic keybind info of your pregenerated config.

I recommend you use the config provided in `examples/hyprland.conf` though.

Paste it into `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`

You can, of course, start from the pregenerated config if you wish to. If you
want the warning to go away, remove the `autogenerated=1` line.

## Monitors

Use `hyprctl monitors` to list available outputs.

Then, you can configure your outputs with

```
hyprctl keyword monitor NAME,RES@HZ,OFFSET,SCALE
```

`NAME` is the name of the display, e.g. `DP-1`, can be empty for a global rule.

`RES@HZ` is the resolution and refresh rate, e.g. `1920x1080@144`

`OFFSET` is the position of the monitor, e.g. `0x0`

`SCALE` is the display scale, e.g. `1`

example command:

```
hyprctl keyword monitor DP-3,1920x1080@240,1920x0,1
```

**Warning!** These changes are **not** permanent! If you want to make those
changes persist, configure your outputs in the config!

# Proper configuring

Head onto the
[Master Configuring Wiki Page](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/wiki/Configuring-Hyprland)
to learn all about configuring Hyprland to your likings.

# Apps / X11 replacements

See the [Useful Utilities Page](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/wiki/Useful-utilities) and the
[Sway wiki page](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/wiki/Useful-add-ons-for-sway)
just about that.

# Screen broken on launch

This usually happens due to your monitor not being very happy about the default
settings.

You can get your monitor's name(s) from the TTY.

Exit hyprland, and then:

- `cat /tmp/hypr/$(ls -t /tmp/hypr | head -n 1)/hyprland.log | grep monitor`
  will give you a bunch of logs about the connected monitors. Names like `DP-x`
  or `HDMI-x` etc are your monitor names.
- edit (with your favorite text editor) `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`
- replace the `monitor=` line with `monitor=NAME,RES@Hz,OFFSET,SCALE`, for
  example `monitor=DP-1,1920x1080@60,0x0,1` (See the above section titled
  Monitors for more info about the values) You can also add multiple of those
  for multi-mon setups.

After this, upon launching Hyprland again, provided you set an appropriate mode
for your monitors, everything should be fine.
