## Getting the log

If you are in a TTY, and the hyprland session that crashed was the last one you
launched, the log will be printed with

```sh
cat /tmp/hypr/$(ls -t /tmp/hypr/ | head -n 1)/hyprland.log
```

feel free to save it to a file, save, copy, etc.

if you are in a Hyprland session, and you want the log of the last session, use

```sh
cat /tmp/hypr/$(ls -t /tmp/hypr/ | head -n 2 | tail -n 1)/hyprland.log
```

## Crashes at launch

Diagnose the issue by what is in the log:

- `sWLRBackend was NULL!` -> launch in the TTY and refer to the wlr logs in RED.
- `Monitor X has NO PREFERRED MODE, and an INVALID one was requested` -> your
  monitor is bork.
- Other -> see the coredump. Use `coredumpctl`, find the latest one's PID and do
  `coredumpctl info PID`.
- failing on a driver (e.g. `radeon`) -> try compiling with
  `make legacyrenderer`, if that doesn't help, report an issue.
- failing on `wlr-xxx` -> try compiling with `make legacyrenderer`, if that
  doesn't help, report an issue, and also refer to the TTY wlr logs in RED like
  in the first point.
- failing on `Hyprland` -> report an issue.
