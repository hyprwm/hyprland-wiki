## Basic

```ini
bind = MODS, key, dispatcher, params
```

for example,

```ini
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, Q, exec, firefox
```

will bind opening Firefox to <key>SUPER</key> + <key>SHIFT</key> + <key>Q</key>

{{< callout type=info >}}

For binding keys without a modkey, leave it empty:

```ini
bind = , Print, exec, grim
```

{{< /callout >}}

_For a complete mod list, see [Variables](../Variables/#variable-types)._

_The dispatcher list can be found in
[Dispatchers](../Dispatchers/#list-of-dispatchers)._

## Uncommon syms / binding with a keycode

See the
[xkbcommon-keysyms.h header](https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon/blob/master/include/xkbcommon/xkbcommon-keysyms.h)
for all the keysyms. The name you should use is the segment after `XKB_KEY_`.

If you are unsure of what your key's name is, you can use `xev` or `wev` to find
that information.

If you want to bind by a keycode, you can put it in the KEY position with
a `code:` prefix, e.g.:

```ini
bind = SUPER, code:28, exec, amongus
```

Will bind <key>SUPER</key> + <key>T</key>. (<key>T</key> is keycode 28.) - You
can also use `xev` or `wev` to find keycodes.

## Misc

### Workspace bindings on non-qwerty layouts

Keys used for keybinds need to be accessible without any modifiers in your layout. For instance, the `French Azerty` layout uses `SHIFT+unmodified_key` to write `0-9` numbers. As such, the workspace keybinds for this layout need to use the names of the `unmodified_key`s, and will not work when using the `0-9` numbers.

{{< callout type=info >}}

To get the correct name for an `unmodified_key`, refer to [the section on uncommon syms](#uncommon-syms--binding-with-a-keycode)

{{< /callout >}}

```ini
# On a french layout, instead of
# bind = $mainMod, 1, workspace,  1

# Use 
bind = $mainMod, ampersand, workspace,  1
```

For help configuring the `French Azerty` layout, [see](https://rherault.dev/articles/hyprland-fr-layout).

### Unbind

You can also unbind with `unbind`, e.g.:

```ini
unbind = SUPER, O
```

May be useful for dynamic keybindings with `hyprctl`:

```bash
hyprctl keyword unbind SUPER, O
```

### Mouse buttons

You can also bind mouse buttons, by prefacing the mouse keycode with `mouse:`,
for example:

```ini
bind = SUPER, mouse:272, exec, amongus
```

will bind it to <key>SUPER</key> + <key>LMB</key>.

### Only modkeys

For binding only modkeys, you need to use the TARGET modmask (with the
activating mod) and the `r` flag, e.g.:

```ini
bindr = SUPER ALT, Alt_L, exec, amongus
```

Will bind `exec amongus` to <key>SUPER</key> + <key>ALT</key>

### Keysym combos

For an arbitrary combination of multiple keys, separate keysyms with `&` between
each mod/key and use the `s` flag, e.g.:

```ini
# You can use a single mod with multiple keys.
binds = Control_L, A&Z, exec, kitty
# You can also specify multiple specific mods.
binds = Control_L&Shift_L, K, exec, kitty
# You can also do both!
binds = Control_R&Super_R&Alt_L, J&K&L, exec, kitty
# If you are feeling a little wild... you can use other keys for binds...
binds = Escape&Apostrophe&F7, T&O&A&D, exec, battletoads 2: retoaded
```

(Please note this is only valid for keysyms and it makes all mods keysyms. If
you don't know what a keysym is use `xev` and press the key you want to use.)

### Mouse wheel

You can also bind the mouse wheel with `mouse_up` and `mouse_down` (or
`mouse_left` and `mouse_right` if your wheel supports horizontal scrolling):

```ini
bind = SUPER, mouse_down, workspace, e-1
```

(control the reset time with `binds:scroll_event_delay`)

### Switches

Useful for binding e.g. the lid close/open event:

```ini
# trigger when the switch is toggled
bindl = , switch:[switch name], exec, swaylock
# trigger when the switch is turning on
bindl = , switch:on:[switch name], exec, hyprctl keyword monitor "eDP-1, disable"
# trigger when the switch is turning off
bindl = , switch:off:[switch name], exec, hyprctl keyword monitor "eDP-1, 2560x1600, 0x0, 1"
```

You can view your switches in `hyprctl devices`.

### Multiple binds to one key

You can trigger multiple actions with one keybind by assigning multiple binds to
one combination, e.g.:

```ini
# to switch between windows in a floating workspace
bind = SUPER, Tab, cyclenext,           # change focus to another window
bind = SUPER, Tab, bringactivetotop,    # bring it to the top
```

The keybinds will be executed in the order they were created. (top to bottom)

### Description

You can describe your keybind with the description flag.
Your description always goes in front of the dispatcher and should never contain the character `,`!

```ini
bindd = MODS, key, description, dispatcher, params
```

for example,

```ini
bindd = SUPER, Q, Open my favourite terminal, exec, kitty
```

If you want to access your description you can use `hyprctl binds`. For more information have a look at [Using Hyprctl](./Using-hyprctl.md).

## Bind flags

`bind` supports flags in this format:

```ini
bind[flags] = ...
```

e.g.:

```ini
bindrl = MOD, KEY, exec, amongus
```

Flags:

```plain
l -> locked, will also work when an input inhibitor (e.g. a lockscreen) is active.
r -> release, will trigger on release of a key.
o -> longPress, will trigger on long press of a key.
e -> repeat, will repeat when held.
n -> non-consuming, key/mouse events will be passed to the active window in addition to triggering the dispatcher.
m -> mouse, see below.
t -> transparent, cannot be shadowed by other binds.
i -> ignore mods, will ignore modifiers.
s -> separate, will arbitrarily combine keys between each mod/key, see [Keysym combos](#keysym-combos) above.
d -> has description, will allow you to write a description for your bind.
p -> bypasses the app's requests to inhibit keybinds.
```

Example Usage:

```ini
# Example volume button that allows press and hold, volume limited to 150%
binde = , XF86AudioRaiseVolume, exec, wpctl set-volume -l 1.5 @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@ 5%+

# Example volume button that will activate even while an input inhibitor is active
bindl = , XF86AudioLowerVolume, exec, wpctl set-volume @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@ 5%-

# Start wofi opens wofi on first press, closes it on second
bindr = SUPER, SUPER_L, exec, pkill wofi || wofi

# Describe a bind
bindd = SUPER, Q, Open my favourite terminal, exec, kitty

# Skip player on long press and only skip 5s on normal press
bindo = SUPER, XF86AudioNext, exec, playerctl next
bind = SUPER, XF86AudioNext, exec, playerctl position +5
```
# See Mouse Binds section for bindm usage
```

## Mouse Binds

Mouse binds are binds that rely on mouse movement. They
will have one less arg, and may look like this:

```ini
bindm = ALT, mouse:272, movewindow
```

This will create a bind with <key>ALT</key> + <key>LMB</key> to move the window
with your mouse.

_Available mouse binds_:

| Name | Description | Params |
| --- | --- | --- |
| movewindow | moves the active window | none |
| resizewindow | resizes the active window | 1 - resize and keep window aspect ratio, 2 - resize and ignore `keepaspectratio` window rule/prop, none or anything else for normal resize |

_Common mouse buttons' codes:_

```txt
LMB -> 272
RMB -> 273
```

_for more, you can of course use `wev` to check._

{{< callout type=info >}}

Mouse binds, despite their name, behave like normal binds. You are free to use
whatever keys / mods you please. When held, the mouse function will be
activated.

{{< /callout >}}

### Touchpad

As clicking and moving the mouse on a touchpad is unergonomic, you can also use keyboard keys instead of mouse clicks too.

```ini
bindm = SUPER, mouse:272, movewindow
bindm = SUPER, Control_L, movewindow
bindm = SUPER, mouse:273, resizewindow
bindm = SUPER, ALT_L, resizewindow
```

## Binding mods

You can bind a mod alone like this:

```ini
bindr = ALT,Alt_L,exec,amongus
```

## Global Keybinds

### Classic

Yes, you heard this right, Hyprland does support global keybinds for ALL apps,
including OBS, Discord, Firefox, etc.

See the [`pass` dispatcher](../Dispatchers/#list-of-dispatchers) and the
[`sendshortcut` dispatcher](../Dispatchers/#list-of-dispatchers) for keybinds.

Let's take OBS as an example: the "Start/Stop Recording" keybind is set to
<key>SUPER</key> + <key>F10</key>, and you want to make it work globally. Simply
add

```ini
bind = SUPER, F10, pass, ^(com\.obsproject\.Studio)$
```

to your config and you're done.

`pass` will pass the PRESS and RELEASE events by itself, no need for a `bindr`.
This also means that push-to-talk will work flawlessly with one pass, e.g.:

```ini
bind = , mouse:276, pass, ^(TeamSpeak 3)$
```

Will pass MOUSE5 to TeamSpeak3.

You may also add shortcuts, where other keys are passed to the window.

```ini
bind = SUPER, F10, sendshortcut, SUPER, F4, ^(com\.obsproject\.Studio)$
```

Will send <key>SUPER</key> + <key>F4</key> to OBS if you press
<key>SUPER</key> + <key>F10</key>.

{{< callout >}}

This works flawlessly with all native Wayland applications. However, XWayland
is a bit wonky. Make sure that what you're passing is a "global Xorg keybind",
otherwise passing from a different XWayland app may not work.

{{< /callout >}}

### DBus Global Shortcuts

Some applications may already support the GlobalShortcuts portal in
xdg-desktop-portal.

If that's the case, then it's recommended to use this method instead of `pass`.

Open your desired app and run `hyprctl globalshortcuts` in a terminal. This will
give you a list of currently registered shortcuts with their description(s).

Choose whichever you like, for example `coolApp:myToggle`, and bind it to
whatever you want with the `global` dispatcher:

```ini
bind = SUPERSHIFT, A, global, coolApp:myToggle
```

{{< callout type=info >}}

Please note that this function will _only_ work with
[XDPH](../../Hypr-Ecosystem/xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland).

{{</ callout >}}

## Submaps

Keybind submaps, also known as _modes_ or _groups_, allow you to activate a
separate set of keybinds. For example, if you want to enter a "resize" mode
which allows you to resize windows with the arrow keys, you can do it like this:

```ini
# will switch to a submap called resize
bind = ALT, R, submap, resize

# will start a submap called "resize"
submap = resize

# sets repeatable binds for resizing the active window
binde = , right, resizeactive, 10 0
binde = , left, resizeactive, -10 0
binde = , up, resizeactive, 0 -10
binde = , down, resizeactive, 0 10

# use reset to go back to the global submap
bind = , escape, submap, reset 

# will reset the submap, which will return to the global submap
submap = reset

# keybinds further down will be global again...
```

{{< callout type=warning >}}

Do not forget a keybind to reset the keymap while inside it! (In this case,
`escape`)

{{< /callout >}}

If you get stuck inside a keymap, you can use `hyprctl dispatch submap reset` to
go back. If you do not have a terminal open, tough luck buddy. You have been
warned.

You can also set the same keybind to perform multiple actions, such as resize
and close the submap, like so:

```ini
bind = ALT, R, submap, resize

submap = resize

bind = , right, resizeactive, 10 0
bind = , right, submap, reset
# ...

submap = reset
```

This works because the binds are executed in the order they appear, and
assigning multiple actions per bind is possible.

## Catch-All

You can also define a keybind via the special `catchall` keyword, which
activates no matter which key is pressed. This can be used to prevent any keys
from passing to your active application while in a submap or to exit it
immediately when any unknown key is pressed:

```ini
bind = , catchall, submap, reset
```

## Example Binds

### Media

These binds set the expected behavior for regular keyboard media volume keys,
including when the screen is locked:

```ini
bindel = , XF86AudioRaiseVolume, exec, wpctl set-volume @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@ 5%+
bindel = , XF86AudioLowerVolume, exec, wpctl set-volume @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@ 5%-
bindl = , XF86AudioMute, exec, wpctl set-mute @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@ toggle
# Requires playerctl
bindl = , XF86AudioPlay, exec, playerctl play-pause
bindl = , XF86AudioPrev, exec, playerctl previous
bindl = , XF86AudioNext, exec, playerctl next
```
