{{< callout type=warning >}}

It is NOT recommended to set DPMS with a keybind directly, as it might cause
undefined behavior. Instead, consider something like

```ini
bind = MOD, KEY, exec, sleep 1 && hyprctl dispatch dpms off
```

{{< /callout >}}

### Grouped (tabbed) windows

Hyprland allows you to make a group from the current active window with the
`togglegroup` bind dispatcher.

A group is like i3wm’s “tabbed” container. It takes the space of one window, and
you can change the window to the next one in the tabbed “group” with the
`changegroupactive` bind dispatcher.

The new group’s border colors are configurable with the appropriate `col.`
settings in the `group` config section.

You can lock a group with the `lockactivegroup` dispatcher in order to stop new
windows from entering this group. In addition, the `lockgroups` dispatcher can be
used to toggle an independent global group lock that will prevent new windows
from entering any groups, regardless of their local group lock stat.

You can prevent a window from being added to a group or becoming a group with the
`denywindowfromgroup` dispatcher. `movewindoworgroup` will behave like
`movewindow` if the current active window or window in direction has this property
set.

## Workspaces

You have nine choices:

- ID: e.g. `1`, `2`, or `3`

- Relative ID: e.g. `+1`, `-3` or `+100`

- workspace on monitor, relative with `+` or `-`, absolute with `~`: e.g. `m+1`,
  `m-2` or `m~3`

- workspace on monitor including empty workspaces, relative with `+` or `-`,
  absolute with `~`: e.g. `r+1` or `r~3`

- open workspace, relative with `+` or `-`, absolute with `~`: e.g. `e+1`,
  `e-10`, or `e~2`

- Name: e.g. `name:Web`, `name:Anime` or `name:Better anime`

- Previous workspace: `previous`, or `previous_per_monitor`

- First available empty workspace: `empty`, suffix with `m` to only search
  on monitor. and/or `n` to make it the *next* available empty workspace. e.g.
  `emptynm`

- Special Workspace: `special` or `special:name` for named special workspaces.

{{< callout type=warning >}}

`special` is supported ONLY on `movetoworkspace` and `movetoworkspacesilent`.
Any other dispatcher will result in undocumented behavior.

{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout >}}

Numerical workspaces (e.g. `1`, `2`, `13371337`) are allowed **ONLY** between 1
and 2147483647 (inclusive)

Neither `0` nor negative numbers are allowed.

{{< /callout >}}

## Special Workspace

A special workspace is what is called a "scratchpad" in some other places. A
workspace that you can toggle on/off on any monitor.

{{< callout type=info >}}

You can define multiple named special workspaces, but the amount of those is
limited to 97 at a time.

{{< /callout >}}

For example, to move a window/application to a special workspace you can use the
following syntax:

```ini
bind = SUPER, C, movetoworkspace, special
#The above syntax will move the window to a special workspace upon pressing 'SUPER'+'C'.
#To see the hidden window you can use the togglespecialworkspace dispatcher mentioned above.
```

## Executing with rules

The `exec` dispatcher supports adding rules. Please note some windows might work
better, some worse. It records the PID of the spawned process and uses that.
For example, if your process forks and then the fork opens a window, this will
not work.

The syntax is:

```ini
bind = mod, key, exec, [rules...] command
```

For example:

```ini
bind = SUPER, E, exec, [workspace 2 silent; float; move 0 0] kitty
```

### setprop

Prop List:

| prop | comment |
| --- | --- |
| alpha | float 0.0 - 1.0 |
| alphaoverride | 0/1, makes the next setting be override instead of multiply |
| alphainactive | float 0.0 - 1.0 |
| alphainactiveoverride | 0/1, makes the next setting be override instead of multiply |
| alphafullscreen | float 0.0 - 1.0 |
| alphafullscreenoverride | 0/1, makes the next setting be override instead of multiply |
| animationstyle | string, cannot be locked |
| activebordercolor | gradient, -1 means not set |
| inactivebordercolor | gradient, -1 means not set |
| maxsize | vec2 (`x y`) |
| minsize | vec2 (`x y`) |

Additional properties can be found in the [Window Rules](../Window-Rules#dynamic-rules) section.

For example:

```sh
address:0x13371337 noanim 1
address:0x13371337 nomaxsize 0
address:0x13371337 opaque toggle
address:0x13371337 immediate unset
