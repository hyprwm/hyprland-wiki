For basic syntax info, see [Configuring Hyprland](../Configuring-Hyprland).

This page documents all the "options" of Hyprland. For binds, monitors, animations,
etc. see the sidebar. For anything else, see [Keywords](../Keywords).

Please keep in mind some options that are layout-specific will be documented in
the layout pages and not here. (See the Sidebar for Dwindle and Master layouts)

# Variable types

| type | description |
|---|---|
| int | integer |
| bool | boolean, `true` or `false` (`yes` or `no`, `0` or `1`) - any numerical value that is not `0` or `1` will cause undefined behaviour. |
| float | floating point number |
| color | color (see hint below for color info) |
| vec2 | vector with 2 values (float), separated by a space (e.g. `0 0` or `-10.9 99.1`) |
| MOD | a string modmask (e.g. `SUPER` or `SUPERSHIFT` or `SUPER + SHIFT` or `SUPER and SHIFT` or `CTRL_SHIFT` or empty for none. You are allowed to put any separators you please except for a `,`) |
| str | a string |

{{< hint type=info >}}

**_Colors:_**

You have 3 options:

rgba(), e.g. `rgba(b3ff1aee)`

rgb(), e.g. `rgb(b3ff1a)`

legacy, e.g. `0xeeb3ff1a` -> ARGB order

**_Mod list:_**

```ini
SHIFT CAPS CTRL/CONTROL ALT MOD2 MOD3 SUPER/WIN/LOGO/MOD4 MOD5
```

# Sections

## General

| name | description | type | default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| sensitivity | mouse sensitivity (legacy, may cause bugs if not 1, prefer `input:sensitivity`) | float | 1.0 |
| border_size | self-explanatory | int | 1 |
| no_border_on_floating | disable borders for floating windows | bool | false |
| gaps_in | gaps between windows | int | 5 |
| gaps_out | gaps between windows and monitor edges | int | 20 |
| col.inactive_border | self-explanatory | color | 0xffffffff |
| col.active_border | self-explanatory | color | 0xff444444 |
| cursor_inactive_timeout | in seconds, after how many seconds of cursor's inactivity to hide it. Set to `0` for never. | int | 0 |
| layout | which layout to use. (Available: `dwindle`, `master`) | str | dwindle |
| no_cursor_warps | if true, will not warp the cursor in many cases (focusing, keybinds, etc) | bool | false |
| apply_sens_to_raw | if on, will also apply the sensitivity to raw mouse output (e.g. sensitivity in games) **NOTICE:** ***really*** not recommended. | bool | false |

{{< hint type=warning >}}
Prefer using `input:sensitivity` over `general:sensitivity` to avoid bugs, especially with Wine/Proton apps.

{{< hint type=info >}}

`blur_size` and `blur_passes` have to be at least 1.

Increasing `blur_passes` is necessary to prevent blur looking wrong on higher `blur_size` values,
but remember that higher `blur_passes` will require more strain on the GPU.

It will, however, cause zero overhead on tiled windows if using `blur_new_optimizations`.

{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint type=warning >}}

Using `blur_new_optimizations` with an animated wallpaper may actually increase GPU usage.

## Follow Mouse

- 0 - disabled
- 1 - full
- 2 - loose. Will focus mouse on other windows on focus but not the keyboard.
- 3 - full loose, will not refocus on click, but allow mouse focus to be
  detached from the keyboard like in 2.
