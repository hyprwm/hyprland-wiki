This page documents known tricks and fixes to boost performance if by any chance
you stumble upon problems or you do not care that much about animations.

## Fractional scaling

Wayland fractional scaling is a lot better than before, but it is not perfect.
Some applications do not support it yet or the support is experimental at best.
If you have problems with your graphics card having high usage or Hyprland
feeling laggy, try setting the scaling to integer numbers such as `1` or `2`
like in this example `monitor=,preferred,auto,2`.

## Low FPS/stutter/FPS drops on Intel iGPU with TLP (mainly laptops)

The TLP defaults are rather aggressive, setting `INTEL_GPU_MIN_FREQ_ON_AC`
and/or `INTEL_GPU_MIN_FREQ_ON_BAT` in `/etc/tlp.conf` to something slightly
higher (e.g. to 500 from 300) will reduce stutter significantly or, in the best
case, remove it completely.

## How do I make Hyprland draw as little power as possible on my laptop?

**_Useful Optimizations_**:

- `decoration:blur:enabled = false` and `decoration:shadow:enabled = false` to disable
  fancy but battery hungry effects.

- `misc:vfr = true`, since it'll lower the amount of sent frames when nothing is
  happening on-screen.

## My games work poorly, especially proton ones

Using `gamescope` tends to fix any and all issues with Wayland/Hyprland.
