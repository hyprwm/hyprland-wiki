Some clients are known for being a massive pain under Wayland. Here are great
replacements for them:

## Discord

- [WebCord](https://github.com/SpacingBat3/WebCord) is a Discord client based on
the latest Electron, with support for Wayland Ozone platform, as well as
PipeWire screensharing. It has tons of great features and tries not to infringe
on the Discord ToS.

- [gtkcord4](https://github.com/diamondburned/gtkcord4) is a Discord client written in GTK4.
While it does infringe on Discord's ToS, it's relatively safe and doesn't rely on any webview technologies.

## Matrix/Element

[Fractal](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal) is a Matrix client written in GTK4.
Much like Discord, Element is known to have a lot of problems as a result of being
based on Electron. Fractal currently doesn't support VoIP calling, but all other features
are supported, including E2EE and cross-device verification.
