### Automatically Mounting Using `udiskie`

_Starting method:_ manual ('exec-once')

USB mass storage devices, like thumb drives, mobile phones, digital cameras,
etc. are not mounted automatically to the file system.

Typically, they have to be manually mounted, often using root and `umount` to do so.

Many popular DEs automatically handle this by using `udisks2` wrappers.

`udiskie` is a udisks2 front-end that allows to manage removable media such as
CDs or flash drives from userspace.

Install `udiskie` via your package manager, or
[build manually](https://github.com/coldfix/udiskie/wiki/installation)

Head over to your `hyprland.conf` and add the following line:

```ini
exec-once = udiskie
```

[See more uses here](https://github.com/coldfix/udiskie/wiki/Usage).
