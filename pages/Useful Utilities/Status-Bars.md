## Waybar

Waybar is a GTK status bar made specifically for wlroots compositors and
supports Hyprland by default. To use it, it's recommended to use your distro's
package.

To start configuring, copy the configuration files from
`/etc/xdg/waybar/` into `~/.config/waybar/`. Then, in `~/.config/waybar/config`

To use the workspaces module, replace all the occurrences of `sway/workspaces`
with `hyprland/workspaces`. Addionally replace all occurences of `sway/mode` with `hyprland/submap`

For more info regarding configuration, see
[The Waybar Wiki](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/wiki/Module:-Hyprland).

### How to launch

Type `waybar` into your terminal. In order to have Waybar launch alongside
Hyprland, add this line to your Hyprland configuration:

```ini
exec-once = waybar
```

Waybar also provides a systemd service. If you use Hyprland with [uwsm](../../Useful-Utilities/Systemd-start), you can enable it, using the following command.

```ini
systemctl --user enable --now waybar.service
```

### Waybar FAQ

#### Waybar popups render behind the windows

In `~/.config/waybar/config`, make sure that you have the `layer` configuration
set to `top` and not `bottom`.

#### Active workspace doesn't show up

Replace `#workspaces button.focused` with `#workspaces button.active` in
`~/.config/waybar/style.css`.

#### Scrolling through workspaces

Since a lot of configuration options from `sway/workspaces` are missing,
you should deduce some of them by yourself. In the case of scrolling, it should
look like this:

```json
"hyprland/workspaces": {
     "format": "{icon}",
     "on-scroll-up": "hyprctl dispatch workspace e+1",
     "on-scroll-down": "hyprctl dispatch workspace e-1"
}
```

### Window title is missing

The prefix for the window module that provides the title is `hyprland` not `wlr`.
In your Waybar config, insert this module:

```json
"modules-center": ["hyprland/window"],
```

If you are using multiple monitors, you may want to insert the following option:

```json
"hyprland/window": {
    "separate-outputs": true
},
```

## Eww

[Eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww) (ElKowar's Wacky Widgets) is a widget
system made in Rust + GTK, which allows the creation of custom widgets
similarly to AwesomeWM. The key difference is that it is independent of window
manager/compositor.

Install Eww either using your distro's package manager, by searching
`eww-wayland`, or by manually compiling. In the latter case, you can follow the
[instructions](https://elkowar.github.io/eww).

### Configuration

There are a few examples listed in the [Readme](https://github.com/elkowar/eww).
It's also highly recommended to read through the
[Configuration options](https://elkowar.github.io/eww/configuration.html).

Read
[the Wayland section](https://elkowar.github.io/eww/configuration.html#wayland)
carefully, otherwise Eww won't work on Hyprland.

Here are some example widgets that might be useful for Hyprland:

<details>
<summary>Workspaces widget</summary>

This widget displays a list of workspaces 1-10. Each workspace can be clicked on
to jump to it, and scrolling over the widget cycles through them. It supports
different styles for the current workspace, occupied workspaces, and empty
workspaces. It requires [bash](https://linux.die.net/man/1/bash),
[awk](https://linux.die.net/man/1/awk),
[stdbuf](https://linux.die.net/man/1/stdbuf),
[grep](https://linux.die.net/man/1/grep),
[seq](https://linux.die.net/man/1/seq),
[socat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/socat),
[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), and [Python 3](https://www.python.org/).

#### `~/.config/eww.yuck`

```lisp
...
(deflisten workspaces :initial "[]" "bash ~/.config/eww/scripts/get-workspaces")
(deflisten current_workspace :initial "1" "bash ~/.config/eww/scripts/get-active-workspace")
(defwidget workspaces []
  (eventbox :onscroll "bash ~/.config/eww/scripts/change-active-workspace {} ${current_workspace}" :class "workspaces-widget"
    (box :space-evenly true
      (label :text "${workspaces}${current_workspace}" :visible false)
      (for workspace in workspaces
        (eventbox :onclick "hyprctl dispatch workspace ${workspace.id}"
          (box :class "workspace-entry ${workspace.windows > 0 ? "occupied" : "empty"}"
            (label :text "${workspace.id}" :class "workspace-entry ${workspace.id == current_workspace ? "current" : ""}" )
            )
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
...
```

#### `~/.config/eww/scripts/change-active-workspace`

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
function clamp {
  min=$1
  max=$2
  val=$3
  python -c "print(max($min, min($val, $max)))"
}

direction=$1
current=$2
if test "$direction" = "down"
then
  target=$(clamp 1 10 $(($current+1)))
  echo "jumping to $target"
  hyprctl dispatch workspace $target
elif test "$direction" = "up"
then
  target=$(clamp 1 10 $(($current-1)))
  echo "jumping to $target"
  hyprctl dispatch workspace $target
fi
```

#### `~/.config/eww/scripts/get-active-workspace`

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

hyprctl monitors -j | jq '.[] | select(.focused) | .activeWorkspace.id'

socat -u UNIX-CONNECT:$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/hypr/$HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE/.socket2.sock - |
  stdbuf -o0 awk -F '>>|,' -e '/^workspace>>/ {print $2}' -e '/^focusedmon>>/ {print $3}'
```

#### `~/.config/eww/scripts/get-workspaces`

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

spaces (){
  WORKSPACE_WINDOWS=$(hyprctl workspaces -j | jq 'map({key: .id | tostring, value: .windows}) | from_entries')
  seq 1 10 | jq --argjson windows "${WORKSPACE_WINDOWS}" --slurp -Mc 'map(tostring) | map({id: ., windows: ($windows[.]//0)})'
}

spaces
socat -u UNIX-CONNECT:$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/hypr/$HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE/.socket2.sock - | while read -r line; do
  spaces
done
```

<details>
<summary>Active window title widget</summary>

This widget simply displays the title of the active window. It requires
[awk](https://linux.die.net/man/1/awk),
[stdbuf](https://linux.die.net/man/1/stdbuf),
[socat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/socat), and
[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

#### `~/.config/eww/eww.yuck`

```lisp
...
(deflisten window :initial "..." "sh ~/.config/eww/scripts/get-window-title")
(defwidget window_w []
  (box
    (label :text "${window}"
    )
  )
...
```

#### `~/.config/eww/scripts/get-window-title`

```sh
#!/bin/sh
hyprctl activewindow -j | jq --raw-output .title
socat -u UNIX-CONNECT:$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/hypr/$HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE/.socket2.sock - | stdbuf -o0 awk -F '>>|,' '/^activewindow>>/{print $3}'
```

## Hybrid

Like Waybar, [Hybrid](https://github.com/vars1ty/HybridBar) is a GTK status bar
mainly focused on wlroots compositors.

It can be installed using the `hybrid-bar` package from the AUR.

### Configuration

The configuration is done through JSON. More information is available
[here](https://github.com/vars1ty/HybridBar).

### How to launch

After configuring HybridBar, it can be launched by typing `hybrid-bar` into a
terminal. It is also possible to set it to launch at startup. To do this, add
this line to `hyprland.conf`:

```ini
exec-once = hybrid-bar
```

#### Blur

To activate blur for your status bar, have a look at [layer rules](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Window-Rules/#layer-rules).
